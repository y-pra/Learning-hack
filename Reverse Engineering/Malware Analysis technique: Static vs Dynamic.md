In malware analysis, two fundamental approaches are used to understand and investigate malicious software: **Static analysis** and **Dynamic analysis**. Each method has its strengths and focuses on different aspects of malware behavior. Here’s a breakdown of both techniques:

### **1. Static Analysis**

**Definition**:  
Static analysis involves examining the malware without executing it. This process analyzes the code, structure, and metadata of the malware file to understand its capabilities.

#### **Techniques**:
- **File Examination**: Checking the file's hash, file type, and size.
- **Disassembly**: Converting the malware’s machine code into assembly language to understand the code's logic and flow.
- **Decompilation**: Attempting to convert the binary code into a higher-level language (like C or Python).
- **String Analysis**: Searching for readable text within the malware’s binary, such as URLs, API calls, or error messages.
- **Header and Metadata Analysis**: Examining the file's headers to identify the compiler used, time stamps, and imports/exports.
- **Signature-based Detection**: Using predefined signatures (like known malicious file hashes) to match known malware patterns.

#### **Advantages**:
- **No execution risk**: Since the malware is not run, there is no risk of infecting the analysis environment.
- **Speed**: Static analysis can be faster than dynamic analysis as it doesn’t require execution over time.
- **Insight into structure**: Can reveal what the malware is intended to do, including potential obfuscation or packing techniques.

#### **Disadvantages**:
- **Limited by obfuscation**: Malware authors often obfuscate or pack their code to make static analysis difficult.
- **No runtime behavior**: Static analysis doesn’t reveal how the malware behaves when executed or interacts with its environment.

### **2. Dynamic Analysis**

**Definition**:  
Dynamic analysis involves executing the malware in a controlled environment (sandbox) to observe its real-time behavior. This method is focused on understanding how the malware operates when it runs.

#### **Techniques**:
- **Sandboxing**: Running the malware in a virtual environment that mimics a real system to observe its actions.
- **Process Monitoring**: Observing the processes created by the malware and monitoring their behavior (e.g., process creation, memory usage).
- **Network Analysis**: Analyzing any outgoing network traffic or communication to command-and-control (C2) servers.
- **File and Registry Monitoring**: Watching for changes to the file system or registry entries as the malware executes.
- **API Calls Monitoring**: Tracking the system API calls made by the malware to understand its interaction with the operating system.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Analyzing specific actions the malware takes, such as creating persistence, injecting code, or stealing data.

#### **Advantages**:
- **Behavioral insight**: Reveals the malware's runtime behavior, including how it interacts with the host, network, and environment.
- **Bypasses obfuscation**: Even if the malware code is obfuscated, dynamic analysis can expose its real behavior.
- **Network activity observation**: Helps detect if the malware attempts to communicate with remote servers or download additional payloads.

#### **Disadvantages**:
- **Execution risk**: Running malware can potentially lead to infections if not properly contained in a sandbox or isolated environment.
- **Slower**: Dynamic analysis may take longer because it involves monitoring the malware’s execution over time.
- **Anti-analysis measures**: Some malware can detect virtual environments or sandboxes and alter its behavior to avoid detection.

### **Comparison Table: Static vs. Dynamic Analysis**

| **Feature**                  | **Static Analysis**                                | **Dynamic Analysis**                               |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Execution**                | No execution involved                             | Malware is executed in a sandbox                  |
| **Focus**                    | Code, structure, and metadata                     | Runtime behavior and interaction with the system  |
| **Speed**                    | Faster as it doesn’t involve running the malware  | Slower since it involves actual execution         |
| **Obfuscation Resistance**   | Can be hindered by obfuscation or packing         | Bypasses obfuscation by observing real behavior   |
| **Risk**                     | No risk of infection                              | Potential risk if the environment is not isolated |
| **Key Tools**                | Disassemblers, decompilers, string search tools   | Sandboxes, process and network monitors           |
| **Visibility**               | Limited to static attributes and code             | Full visibility into how the malware behaves      |
| **Examples of Tools**        | IDA Pro, Ghidra, PE Explorer                      | Cuckoo Sandbox, Wireshark, Process Monitor        |

### **Conclusion**:
- **Static analysis** is excellent for quickly identifying known threats and understanding the structure of malware without the risk of execution.
- **Dynamic analysis** provides a deeper understanding of how malware operates in real-time, which is crucial for advanced malware that uses techniques like obfuscation or encryption.

Both static and dynamic analyses are complementary techniques, and combining them gives a complete view of malware behavior and capabilities.
