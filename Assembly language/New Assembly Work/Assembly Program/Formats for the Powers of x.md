When working with fixed-point arithmetic or other numerical representations, representing powers of a variable (such as \(x\)) is a common requirement. Here, I'll explain various formats for representing powers of \(x\) in fixed-point and other systems.

### Fixed-Point Representation of Powers of \(x\)

1. **Basic Format**:
   - In a fixed-point system, a power of \(x\) can be represented as $\(x^n\)$, where \(n\) is an integer.
   - If \(x\) is represented as a fixed-point number (e.g., **16.16**), then \(x^n\) can be computed using repeated multiplication.

2. **Example of Fixed-Point Powers**:
   - Suppose you have a fixed-point number $\(x = 0x00018000\)$ (which represents $\(1.5\)$ in **16.16** format).
   - To calculate $\(x^2\)$ (or $\(1.5^2\))$:
     - **Multiply \(x\) by itself**: 
       $\[
       x^2 = x \times x
       \]$
     - If the result exceeds the fixed-point representation, it may require adjustment or clipping.

### Floating-Point Representation of Powers of \(x\)

1. **Using Exponents**:
   - In floating-point systems, a number is represented in scientific notation, typically as $\(m \times 2^e\)$ (for binary) or $\(m \times 10^e\)$ (for decimal).
   - Powers of \(x\) can be computed using built-in functions (e.g., `pow(x, n)`).

2. **Example of Floating-Point Powers**:
   - For a floating-point number \(x = 1.5\), $\(x^2\)$ can be computed using:
     ```python
     result = pow(1.5, 2)  # result will be 2.25
     ```

### Polynomial Representation

For powers of \(x\) in polynomial form, such as $\(a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + ... + a_1 x + a_0\)$, the coefficients can also be represented in fixed-point format. Here’s how you can work with it:

1. **Polynomial Evaluation (Horner's Method)**:
   - This method is efficient for evaluating polynomials.
   - Given coefficients $\(a_n, a_{n-1}, ..., a_0\)$ in fixed-point format, you can compute $\(P(x)\)$ as:
     $\[
     P(x) = ((a_n x + a_{n-1}) x + a_{n-2}) x + ... + a_1 x + a_0
     \]$

2. **Example**:
   - For a polynomial $\(P(x) = 1.5 x^2 + 2.25 x + 0.75\)$ with \(x = 1.5\):
     - Convert coefficients to fixed-point format:
       - \(1.5\) = `0x00018000`
       - \(2.25\) = `0x00024000`
       - \(0.75\) = `0x000C0000`
     - Evaluate using Horner’s method.

### Assembly Code Example for Powers of \(x\) in Fixed-Point (16.16 Format)

Here’s an example of calculating \(x^2\) in assembly:

```assembly
section .data
    x       dd  0x00018000      ; 1.5 in 16.16 fixed-point format
    result  dd  0                ; To store the result of x^2

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    mov     eax, [x]             ; Load x (1.5)
    imul    eax, eax             ; x^2 = x * x

    ; Now, eax contains the result of x^2, but we need to adjust scaling
    shr     eax, 16              ; Shift right by 16 bits to adjust for fixed-point scaling

    mov     [result], eax        ; Store result in memory

    ; Exit system call
    mov     eax, 60              ; exit system call number
    xor     edi, edi             ; exit code 0
    syscall
```

### Summary of Representing Powers of \(x\)

- **Fixed-Point**: Use repeated multiplication and adjust the result using shifts.
- **Floating-Point**: Use built-in functions to compute powers directly.
- **Polynomial Representation**: Use Horner’s method for efficient evaluation with fixed-point coefficients.
