Fixed-point addition and subtraction in assembly language are similar to performing integer operations but with a critical detail: both numbers must have the same scaling factor (i.e., the same number of fractional bits) to ensure the correct result. If the two fixed-point numbers have the same format (e.g., both are in **16.16 fixed-point** format), you can perform addition and subtraction as you would with integers. The result remains in the same fixed-point format.

### Steps for Fixed-Point Addition and Subtraction

1. **Ensure Consistent Scaling**: Both numbers must have the same scaling factor (i.e., the same number of fractional bits).
2. **Perform the Operation**: Add or subtract the numbers as if they were integers.
3. **Result Interpretation**: The result will still be in the fixed-point format.

### Example: Fixed-Point Addition and Subtraction (16.16 Format)

For example, in **16.16 fixed-point** format, two numbers like `0x0001_8000` (1.5 in decimal) and `0x0002_4000` (2.25 in decimal) can be added directly.

#### 16.16 Format Breakdown:
- `0x0001_8000` = $\(1 + \frac{32768}{65536} = 1.5\)$
- `0x0002_4000` = $\(2 + \frac{16384}{65536} = 2.25\)$

### Assembly Code Example (x86)

Here’s how you can add and subtract fixed-point numbers in **16.16 format**:

```assembly
section .data
    num1    dd  0x00018000      ; fixed-point number 1 (1.5 in 16.16 format)
    num2    dd  0x00024000      ; fixed-point number 2 (2.25 in 16.16 format)

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; Fixed-point addition
    mov     eax, [num1]         ; load first fixed-point number
    add     eax, [num2]         ; add second fixed-point number
    ; Now eax contains the result of 1.5 + 2.25 = 3.75 in fixed-point (0x0003C000)
    
    ; To verify, we'll now perform subtraction of the same two numbers
    mov     ebx, eax            ; store addition result for reference

    ; Fixed-point subtraction
    mov     eax, [num1]         ; load first fixed-point number again
    sub     eax, [num2]         ; subtract second fixed-point number
    ; Now eax contains the result of 1.5 - 2.25 = -0.75 in fixed-point (0xFFFFC000)
    
    ; Exit system call
    mov     eax, 60             ; exit system call number
    xor     edi, edi            ; exit code 0
    syscall
```

### Explanation:
1. **Addition**:
   - `0x0001_8000` (1.5 in decimal) and `0x0002_4000` (2.25 in decimal) are added.
   - The result is `0x0003_C000`, which represents $\( 3 + \frac{49152}{65536} = 3.75 \)$.

2. **Subtraction**:
   - `0x0001_8000` (1.5 in decimal) minus `0x0002_4000` (2.25 in decimal) results in `0xFFFF_C000`, which is negative. This is because in two’s complement, the number `0xFFFF_C000` represents -0.75 in 16.16 fixed-point format.

### Key Operations:
- **`ADD`** and **`SUB`**: Both of these operations work as expected with fixed-point numbers, as long as both numbers use the same format.
- **Two’s Complement**: When subtracting, remember that the result may be negative, and it will be represented in two's complement form.

### Interpreting Results:
- The result of addition or subtraction is still in the fixed-point format. If you want to convert this back to a human-readable format (like a floating-point decimal), you can extract the integer and fractional parts as explained earlier.
  
### Example Results:
- **Addition Result**: $\(1.5 + 2.25 = 3.75\)$, stored as `0x0003_C000` in 16.16 format.
- **Subtraction Result**: $\(1.5 - 2.25 = -0.75\)$, stored as `0xFFFF_C000` in 16.16 format (in two's complement).

### Handling Different Fixed-Point Formats:
- If the two fixed-point numbers have different scaling factors (e.g., **16.16** and **8.24**), you must first align the formats by shifting one of the numbers appropriately. For instance, to add a **16.16** fixed-point number to a **32.32** fixed-point number, you'd shift the **16.16** number left by 16 bits to convert it into **32.32** format.
