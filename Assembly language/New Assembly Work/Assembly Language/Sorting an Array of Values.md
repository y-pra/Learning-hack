Sorting an array of values is a common task in programming, and in High-Level Assembly (HLA), you can implement various sorting algorithms. Below, I'll demonstrate how to sort an array of integers using the **Bubble Sort** algorithm, which is simple and easy to understand. 

### 1. **Bubble Sort Algorithm Overview**

Bubble Sort works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The process continues until no swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.

### 2. **Implementing Bubble Sort in HLA**

Hereâ€™s a complete HLA program that sorts an array of integers using Bubble Sort:

```assembly
program BubbleSortExample;

#include("stdlib.hhf")

begin BubbleSortExample;

    // Declare and initialize a single-dimensional array of integers
    intArray: int[5] := (5, 2, 9, 1, 5);
    n: int := 5;            // Size of the array
    i: int;                // Outer loop counter
    j: int;                // Inner loop counter
    temp: int;             // Temporary variable for swapping

    // Output original array
    stdout.put("Original Array: ", intArray, nl);

    // Bubble Sort algorithm
    for(i := 0; i < n - 1; i++) do
        for(j := 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) do
            if(intArray[j] > intArray[j + 1]) then
                // Swap intArray[j] and intArray[j + 1]
                temp := intArray[j];
                intArray[j] := intArray[j + 1];
                intArray[j + 1] := temp;
            end if;
        end for;
    end for;

    // Output sorted array
    stdout.put("Sorted Array: ", intArray, nl);

end BubbleSortExample;
```

### 3. **Explanation of the Code**

1. **Array Declaration**:
   - The array `intArray` is declared and initialized with 5 integers.
   - The variable `n` holds the size of the array, and `i` and `j` are used as loop counters.

2. **Output Original Array**:
   - The original array is printed using `stdout.put`.

3. **Bubble Sort Algorithm**:
   - The outer loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, ensuring all passes through the array are completed.
   - The inner loop iterates through the unsorted section of the array. For each pair of adjacent elements, it checks if they are out of order.
   - If the current element is greater than the next element, they are swapped using a temporary variable `temp`.

4. **Output Sorted Array**:
   - After sorting, the sorted array is printed.

### 4. **Performance Consideration**

Bubble Sort is not the most efficient sorting algorithm, especially for large datasets, with an average and worst-case time complexity of \(O(n^2)\). However, it is suitable for small arrays or educational purposes due to its simplicity.

### 5. **Alternative Sorting Algorithms**

While the Bubble Sort is straightforward, you can explore other sorting algorithms such as:
- **Selection Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
