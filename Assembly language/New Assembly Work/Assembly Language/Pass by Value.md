**Pass by value** is a method of passing arguments to functions or procedures in which a copy of the actual value is passed, rather than the original variable itself. This means that changes made to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original variable outside of the function. 

### Key Concepts of Pass by Value

1. **Copying the Value**: When a variable is passed by value, a copy of the variable's data is created and sent to the function. This copy is used inside the function.

2. **Original Variable Unchanged**: Any modifications made to the parameter within the function do not impact the original variable. The original variable retains its value.

3. **Memory Management**: Since a copy of the variable is created, this method can consume more memory, especially for large data structures or objects.

### Example of Pass by Value in Assembly Language

Hereâ€™s a simple example in High-Level Assembly (HLA) that demonstrates the concept of pass by value:

```assembly
program PassByValueExample;

#include("stdlib.hhf")

// Procedure that takes an integer as a parameter
procedure ModifyValue(val num: int);
begin ModifyValue;
    num := num + 10;  // Modify the copy of the variable
end ModifyValue;

begin PassByValueExample;

    // Declare an integer variable
    variable originalValue: int := 5;

    stdout.put("Original Value before calling ModifyValue: ", originalValue, nl);

    // Call the procedure and pass originalValue by value
    ModifyValue(originalValue);

    stdout.put("Original Value after calling ModifyValue: ", originalValue, nl); // Original value remains unchanged

end PassByValueExample;
```

### Explanation of the Example

1. **Variable Declaration**: The program declares an integer variable `originalValue` and initializes it to `5`.

2. **Procedure Definition**: The `ModifyValue` procedure takes an integer parameter `num`. Inside the procedure, `num` is modified by adding `10` to it.

3. **Calling the Procedure**: The procedure `ModifyValue` is called with `originalValue` as the argument. A copy of `originalValue` is created and passed to `num`.

4. **Output**: 
   - Before calling the procedure, the program prints the original value.
   - After calling the procedure, the program prints the original value again. It remains `5`, demonstrating that the modification to `num` inside the procedure does not affect `originalValue`.

### Advantages of Pass by Value

- **Data Integrity**: Since the original variable is not modified, this method protects against unintended side effects.
- **Simplicity**: It simplifies debugging and understanding of code, as the function's behavior does not alter the state of the calling environment.

### Disadvantages of Pass by Value

- **Performance**: Creating copies of large data structures can be inefficient in terms of memory and processing time.
- **No Modification**: You cannot change the original variable from within the function, which might be a limitation in some scenarios.

### Conclusion

Pass by value is a fundamental concept in programming that emphasizes the use of copies rather than direct references to variables. It is widely used in assembly language programming, particularly in the context of procedures and functions.
