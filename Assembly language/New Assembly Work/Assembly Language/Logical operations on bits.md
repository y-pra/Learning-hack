Logical operations on bits are fundamental operations in digital electronics and computer science. They operate on binary data, manipulating individual bits according to specific rules. The most common logical operations are AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR. Here’s a detailed look at each of these operations:

### 1. AND Operation
- **Symbol**: `&` or `⋅`
- **Operation**: The AND operation results in `1` if both input bits are `1`; otherwise, it results in `0`.
- **Truth Table**:

  | A | B | A AND B (A & B) |
  |---|---|------------------|
  | 0 | 0 | 0                |
  | 0 | 1 | 0                |
  | 1 | 0 | 0                |
  | 1 | 1 | 1                |

- **Example**:  
  \( 1 \& 1 = 1 \)  
  \( 1 \& 0 = 0 \)

### 2. OR Operation
- **Symbol**: `|` or `+`
- **Operation**: The OR operation results in `1` if at least one of the input bits is `1`; otherwise, it results in `0`.
- **Truth Table**:

  | A | B | A OR B (A | B) |
  |---|---|----------------|
  | 0 | 0 | 0              |
  | 0 | 1 | 1              |
  | 1 | 0 | 1              |
  | 1 | 1 | 1              |

- **Example**:  
  \( 1 | 0 = 1 \)  
  \( 0 | 0 = 0 \)

### 3. NOT Operation
- **Symbol**: `¬` or `!`
- **Operation**: The NOT operation (also called negation) inverts the value of the bit; it results in `1` if the input is `0` and `0` if the input is `1`.
- **Truth Table**:

  | A | NOT A (¬A) |
  |---|-------------|
  | 0 | 1           |
  | 1 | 0           |

- **Example**:  
  \( ¬1 = 0 \)  
  \( ¬0 = 1 \)

### 4. NAND Operation
- **Symbol**: `↑` or `A NAND B`
- **Operation**: The NAND operation is the negation of the AND operation. It results in `0` only if both inputs are `1`; otherwise, it results in `1`.
- **Truth Table**:

  | A | B | A NAND B (A ↑ B) |
  |---|---|-------------------|
  | 0 | 0 | 1                 |
  | 0 | 1 | 1                 |
  | 1 | 0 | 1                 |
  | 1 | 1 | 0                 |

- **Example**:  
  \( 1 \uparrow 1 = 0 \)  
  \( 1 \uparrow 0 = 1 \)

### 5. NOR Operation
- **Symbol**: `↓` or `A NOR B`
- **Operation**: The NOR operation is the negation of the OR operation. It results in `1` only if both inputs are `0`; otherwise, it results in `0`.
- **Truth Table**:

  | A | B | A NOR B (A ↓ B) |
  |---|---|------------------|
  | 0 | 0 | 1                |
  | 0 | 1 | 0                |
  | 1 | 0 | 0                |
  | 1 | 1 | 0                |

- **Example**:  
  \( 0 \downarrow 0 = 1 \)  
  \( 1 \downarrow 0 = 0 \)

### 6. XOR (Exclusive OR) Operation
- **Symbol**: `⊕`
- **Operation**: The XOR operation results in `1` if exactly one of the inputs is `1`; otherwise, it results in `0`.
- **Truth Table**:

  | A | B | A XOR B (A ⊕ B) |
  |---|---|------------------|
  | 0 | 0 | 0                |
  | 0 | 1 | 1                |
  | 1 | 0 | 1                |
  | 1 | 1 | 0                |

- **Example**:  
  \( 1 \oplus 0 = 1 \)  
  \( 1 \oplus 1 = 0 \)

### 7. XNOR (Exclusive NOR) Operation
- **Symbol**: `⊙`
- **Operation**: The XNOR operation is the negation of the XOR operation. It results in `1` if both inputs are the same; otherwise, it results in `0`.
- **Truth Table**:

  | A | B | A XNOR B (A ⊙ B) |
  |---|---|-------------------|
  | 0 | 0 | 1                 |
  | 0 | 1 | 0                 |
  | 1 | 0 | 0                 |
  | 1 | 1 | 1                 |

- **Example**:  
  $\( 1 \odot 1 = 1 \)$  
  $\( 0 \odot 1 = 0 \)$
