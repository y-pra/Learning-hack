**Pass by reference** is a method of passing arguments to functions or procedures in which a reference (or address) to the actual variable is passed instead of a copy of its value. This allows the function to directly modify the original variable, as it has access to its memory location.

### Key Concepts of Pass by Reference

1. **Direct Access**: When a variable is passed by reference, the function can access and modify the original variable's data directly.

2. **Memory Efficiency**: Since only the reference (or address) is passed, it is more memory-efficient than passing large data structures by value.

3. **Impact on Original Variable**: Changes made to the parameter within the function affect the original variable outside the function, leading to potential side effects.

### Example of Pass by Reference in Assembly Language

Hereâ€™s a simple example in High-Level Assembly (HLA) that demonstrates the concept of pass by reference:

```assembly
program PassByReferenceExample;

#include("stdlib.hhf")

// Procedure that takes a reference to an integer as a parameter
procedure ModifyValue(ref num: int);
begin ModifyValue;
    num := num + 10;  // Modify the original variable
end ModifyValue;

begin PassByReferenceExample;

    // Declare an integer variable
    variable originalValue: int := 5;

    stdout.put("Original Value before calling ModifyValue: ", originalValue, nl);

    // Call the procedure and pass originalValue by reference
    ModifyValue(originalValue);

    stdout.put("Original Value after calling ModifyValue: ", originalValue, nl); // Original value is modified

end PassByReferenceExample;
```

### Explanation of the Example

1. **Variable Declaration**: The program declares an integer variable `originalValue` and initializes it to `5`.

2. **Procedure Definition**: The `ModifyValue` procedure takes a reference to an integer parameter `num`. Inside the procedure, `num` is modified by adding `10` to it.

3. **Calling the Procedure**: The procedure `ModifyValue` is called with `originalValue` as the argument. Since it is passed by reference, `num` refers to the same memory location as `originalValue`.

4. **Output**:
   - Before calling the procedure, the program prints the original value.
   - After calling the procedure, the program prints the original value again, which is now `15`. This demonstrates that the modification to `num` inside the procedure directly affects `originalValue`.

### Advantages of Pass by Reference

- **Efficiency**: It is more memory-efficient for large data structures, as only the address is passed instead of creating a copy.
- **Ability to Modify**: Functions can modify the original variables, which can be useful in many scenarios where the return of modified values is required.

### Disadvantages of Pass by Reference

- **Side Effects**: Since the original variable can be modified, it can lead to unintended side effects, making the code harder to debug.
- **Complexity**: Understanding how references work can add complexity, particularly for beginners, as changes in one part of the code can affect other parts.

### Conclusion

Pass by reference is a powerful method in programming that allows functions to modify the original variables directly. It is widely used in assembly language programming, especially when dealing with larger data structures.
