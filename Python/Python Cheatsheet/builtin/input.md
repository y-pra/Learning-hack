## Examples

This function takes the input from the user and converts it into a string:

```python
>>> print('What is your name?')   # ask for their name
>>> my_name = input()
>>> print('Hi, {}'.format(my_name))
# What is your name?
# Martha
# Hi, Martha
```

`input()` can also set a default message without using `print()`:

```python
>>> my_name = input('What is your name? ')  # default message
>>> print('Hi, {}'.format(my_name))
# What is your name? Martha
# Hi, Martha
```
