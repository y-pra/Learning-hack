## Introduction

In Python, the `callable()` function is a built-in function that can be used to determine if an object is callable, meaning it can be invoked as a function.

It returns `True` if the object passed to it is callable and `False` otherwise. For example, a function, a method, a class, a lambda function, and a generator are all callable objects in Python.

Here is an example of how you can use the `callable()` function:

```python
>>> def my_function():
...     pass
...
>>> class MyClass:
...     def __call__(self):
...         pass
...
>>> x = 5
>>> y = my_function
>>> z = MyClass()
>>> a = lambda: None
>>>
>>> print(callable(x))
# False
>>> print(callable(y))
# True
>>> print(callable(z))
# True
>>> print(callable(a))
# True
```

In the above example, `my_function` is a function and it is callable, `MyClass` is a class and it is callable as well because it has a `__call__` method, `z` is an instance of the class `MyClass` and it is also callable because it has a `__call__` method and `a` is a lambda function which is callable.

The `callable()` function can be useful in situations where you need to determine if an object can be invoked as a function, such as when you are working with callbacks or other types of function pointers.
