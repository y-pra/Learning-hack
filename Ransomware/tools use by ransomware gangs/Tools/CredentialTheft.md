## Credential Theft Tools

> [!TIP]
> There are a number of free password recovery tools availbel that are designed to help users recover lost or forgotten passwords stored on their own systems. These tools can extract passwords saved in web browsers, email clients, and other applications. IT professionals can use these tools to recover credentials needed for system maintenance or troubleshooting.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If these tools are run on a computer without the owner's permission by an adversary, they can be used to harvest passwords illicitly, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information.
